           <p> Aahaar is a food donation and redistribution initiative platform 
            committed to reducing food waste and fighting hunger. 
            Every day, tons of perfectly edible food goes to waste while millions go to bed hungry.
             Ahaar bridges this gap by collecting surplus food from restaurants, events, and 
             households, and redistributing it to those in need. 
             </p> 
             <p> Our mission is to create a sustainable and hunger-free world, one meal at a time. With the help of our dedicated
               volunteers and partners, we ensure that good food reaches the
                people who need it the most â€” safely and efficiently. 
                </p> 
                <p> 
                  Join us in our journey to feed the hungry and reduce food waste.
                   Together, we can make a difference.
